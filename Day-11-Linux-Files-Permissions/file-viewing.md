# Viewing Files in Linux

Linux provides multiple commands to view file contents.

Commands practiced:
- cat: Display full file content
- cat -n: Display content with line numbers
- head -n: Display first N lines
- tail -n: Display last N lines
- head -c / tail -c: Display characters instead of lines

These commands are useful for log analysis and file inspection.
