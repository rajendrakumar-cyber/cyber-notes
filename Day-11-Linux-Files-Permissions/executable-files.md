# Executable Files in Linux

Executable permission allows files to be run as programs.

Key points:
- Execution requires x permission
- chmod is used to modify permissions
- Scripts can be executed once permission is granted

Security Note:
Executable files are closely monitored
to prevent malicious execution.
