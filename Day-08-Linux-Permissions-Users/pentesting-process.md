# Penetration Testing Process

Penetration testing is a structured approach to finding security weaknesses
in systems and networks.

## Common Phases
1. Planning and Scoping
2. Reconnaissance
3. Scanning and Enumeration
4. Exploitation
5. Post-Exploitation
6. Reporting

The goal is to identify risks and help organizations improve security,
not to cause damage.
