# Enterprise Environment – Building and Working

An enterprise environment consists of:
- Users
- Endpoints (PCs, laptops)
- Servers
- Network devices
- Security controls

## How It Works
Users access resources through controlled networks.
Security teams monitor activity to detect threats
and respond to incidents.

Strong processes and policies are as important as tools.
