# OSI Model

The OSI model explains how data moves through a network in seven layers.

1. Physical – Cables and signals
2. Data Link – MAC address, switching
3. Network – IP address and routing
4. Transport – TCP and UDP
5. Session – Session management
6. Presentation – Encryption and formatting
7. Application – HTTP, FTP, DNS

## Why OSI Model Is Important
It helps security professionals understand where attacks and defenses occur.
